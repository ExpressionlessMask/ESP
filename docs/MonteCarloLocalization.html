<h1>Monte Carlo Localization</h1>
<p>One of the most popular localization algortihms that is widely used in probabilistic robotics is the Monte Carlo Localization
algorithm. It has one key difference that makes it both easy to impolement, computationally effective, and robust in both local
and global localization. Instead one single Gaussian distribution, it uses thousands of particles to estimate its position.
<br><br>
MCL is a Particle Filter type algorithm, which means that the belief of the robot is modeled as a cloud of particles - possible
states the robot may be in. The algorithm is as follows:<br></p>

1) The robot models the initial belief as a uniform distribution across a known map.
Every particle has equal weight.<br><br>
2) The robot scans its surroundings. Based on the observations, some particles are given increased weight, some decreased.
<br><br>
3) The robot then resamples the belief with respect to the weight of the particles (one such algortihm is Rejection Sampling)
and shits the new distribution based on its movement. The uniform distribution becomes more concentrated where the robot thinks 
it is. The weight is reset. <br><br>
4) The robot makes another observation, assigns weight, resamples and shifts. In a non-monotone environment it would reach a
tight cluster of particles-states in a small amount of iterations.

<p> 
This algorithm allows the robot to localize itself both globally, with the help of the map and unique features of the terrain,<br>
and locally, where it counteracts the noise produced by measurements and odometry with observations.<br>
Another strength of MCl is absolute independence from unimodal belief distribution and linear Gaussian transformations.<br>
Its accuraccy can be traded off with computational time by increasing the number of particles. 
<br><br>
There is an issue that a default MCL cannot resolve: the Kidnapped Robot Problem. After successfully establishing it's position,
the <br> robot is vulnerable to sudden displacements. Since all the particles are concentrated in a single wrong spot, it cannot properly
<br> relocalize itself in that state. <br>
Fortunately the solution is fairly simple. After every iteration, the algorithm just has to insert a few random points across the map.<br>
It will allow the robot to constantly reevaluate seemingly impossible points, which only adds robustness to the localization algorithm <br> whether the robot was kidnapped or not.
