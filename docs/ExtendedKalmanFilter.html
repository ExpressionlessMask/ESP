<h1>Extended Kalman Filter</h1>
<p>In cases where the belief cannot be always expressed as a linear transformation of a Gaussian random variable, rendering the 
posterior distribution impossible to calculate by normal means, a solution exists: those non-linear transformations are linearized 
with a first-order Taylor expansion centered at the mean of the previous Gaussian. This allows for the final distribution to be of 
a Gaussian shape again allowing the algorithm to work again. While this approach is much more efficient compared to the Monte Carlo
method used to calculate the non-Gaussian posterior, it also introduces its own error to the final mean and variance. Just like KF
it is unable to work with multimodal distributions.
