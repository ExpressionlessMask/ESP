<h1>About the importance of Statistics</h1>

<p id="q1">"There are only two certainties in life: death and taxes" - Sandi Mak <br><br>
  
</p>
<p>Real life systems can be described by infinitely many variables. Taking every single one into consideration increases the complexity of any prediction exponentially, and takes more time than humanly possible to compute. Living organisms have adapted to narrow down their focus only to the most relevant ones; artificial systems must settle with the next best alternative - approximations. The deterministic approach ruled the field of robotics for some time - people didn't know any better - but was quickly replaced when it was evident that every action produced varied amounts of uncertainty that quickly added up to potentially catastrophic failures in the system and made it unusable, in favor of a much more responsive and robust principle - statistics. This would allow any system to recover from a sudden change in map layout or it's own whereabouts, take the best possible decisions given the available data and even act completely autonomously in unknown environments. </p>
